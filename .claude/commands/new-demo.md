# /new-demo — Scaffold Demo Wizard

You are a demo setup wizard. Walk the user through **9 phases (Phase 0 through Phase 8)** to configure, build, and deploy a new Databricks demo from the scaffold. Each phase has a specific purpose and explicit parallelization instructions.

**DO NOT write any code until the user approves the plan in Phase 6.**

## Rules

1. **One phase at a time.** Complete each phase fully before moving to the next.
2. **Use AskUserQuestion** for every question. Never assume answers.
3. **After each phase**, write the answers to `PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml` (append, don't overwrite previous phases). `PROJECT_DIR` is set during Phase 0.
4. **Show a phase summary** after each phase so the user can correct anything.
5. **Use the Task tool for parallel work** wherever marked with `[PARALLEL]`. Launch multiple sub-agents simultaneously.
6. **Stay within the /new-demo flow** for the entire lifecycle — Q&A, planning, code gen, deployment, and verification. Do NOT break out of this flow.
7. **All file operations target `PROJECT_DIR`** after Phase 0 completes. Never write generated files back into the scaffold directory.
8. **Resume detection:** If `demo-config.yaml` exists in the current directory with a `phase_0:` section, skip Phase 0 and resume at the first incomplete phase.

---

## Phase 0: Project Setup

This phase creates a separate project directory from the scaffold so generated files don't pollute the reusable template.

### Step 0.0: Resume Detection

Check the current working directory for `demo-config.yaml`:

1. **If `demo-config.yaml` exists WITH a `phase_0:` section** — This is a resumed session. Read the config, set `PROJECT_DIR` from `phase_0.project_dir`, and skip to the first incomplete phase (the first phase that does NOT have a corresponding section in the config). Tell the user: "Resuming your `<demo_name>` project. Picking up at Phase N."

2. **If `demo-config.yaml` exists WITHOUT a `phase_0:` section** — This is a legacy config from before Phase 0 was added. Warn the user:
   - "I found a `demo-config.yaml` but it was created before the project setup phase existed. Your generated files may be mixed into the scaffold directory."
   - Ask: "Would you like to: (a) Migrate — I'll create a new project directory and move your files there, (b) Continue in-place — keep working in this directory as-is, (c) Start fresh — begin a brand new project"

3. **If NO `demo-config.yaml` AND current directory has scaffold sentinel files (`skills/` directory AND `QUICKSTART.md`)** — Fresh start from the scaffold. Continue to Step 0.1.

4. **If NO `demo-config.yaml` AND current directory does NOT have scaffold sentinels** — The user isn't in the scaffold directory. Ask: "I don't see the scaffold files here. Would you like to: (a) Create a new project in this directory, (b) Point me to the scaffold directory to copy from"

### Step 0.1: Ask for project directory

Tell the user: "First, let's create a project directory. The scaffold stays clean as a reusable template — your demo gets its own directory."

Ask (use AskUserQuestion):

**Project directory** — Where should I create your project?
- Suggest: `../<demo-name>/` (sibling to the scaffold, using a slugified version of any name they've mentioned)
- Accept relative or absolute paths
- Resolve the final path to an absolute path using the scaffold's parent directory as the base for relative paths

### Step 0.2: Validate the path

Apply these checks in order:

1. **If the path is INSIDE the scaffold directory** (is a subdirectory of the current working directory) — Reject with: "The project directory can't be inside the scaffold — that defeats the purpose of separation. Please choose a sibling or external directory."

2. **If the path exists and contains files** — Warn the user: List the files/directories present and ask: "This directory already has files. Should I copy the scaffold here? (Existing files with the same name will be overwritten by scaffold versions. Any files not in the scaffold will be preserved.)"

3. **If the path exists but is empty** — Proceed silently.

4. **If the path doesn't exist** — Create it with `mkdir -p`.

Set `PROJECT_DIR` to the resolved absolute path. All subsequent file operations in this wizard target `PROJECT_DIR`.

### Step 0.3: Copy scaffold structure

Copy the scaffold files to `PROJECT_DIR`. Use the Bash tool to copy each group. **Do NOT copy:** `.git/`, `.gitmodules`, `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `skill/`.

```bash
# Copy the scaffold structure to the project directory
SCAFFOLD_DIR="<current working directory>"
PROJECT_DIR="<resolved project path>"

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p "$PROJECT_DIR"/{app/backend/core,app/frontend/src,lakebase,notebooks,agent_bricks,genie_spaces,docs,examples,.claude/commands}

# Copy app layer
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/app/app.yaml "$PROJECT_DIR"/app/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/app/requirements.txt "$PROJECT_DIR"/app/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/app/backend/__init__.py "$PROJECT_DIR"/app/backend/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/app/backend/main.py "$PROJECT_DIR"/app/backend/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/app/backend/core/*.py "$PROJECT_DIR"/app/backend/core/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/app/frontend/src/index.html "$PROJECT_DIR"/app/frontend/src/

# Copy lakebase schemas
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/lakebase/*.sql "$PROJECT_DIR"/lakebase/

# Copy notebooks
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/notebooks/* "$PROJECT_DIR"/notebooks/

# Copy agent configs
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/agent_bricks/*.json "$PROJECT_DIR"/agent_bricks/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/genie_spaces/*.json "$PROJECT_DIR"/genie_spaces/

# Copy lakebase-mcp-server (excluding .git, __pycache__, *.pyc)
rsync -a --exclude='.git' --exclude='__pycache__' --exclude='*.pyc' "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/lakebase-mcp-server/ "$PROJECT_DIR"/lakebase-mcp-server/

# Copy claude commands (so /new-demo works for resume in the new project)
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/.claude/commands/*.md "$PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/commands/

# Copy docs and examples (needed by Phase 6 and Phase 7)
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/docs/*.md "$PROJECT_DIR"/docs/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/examples/*.py "$PROJECT_DIR"/examples/

# Copy root files
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/CLAUDE.md "$PROJECT_DIR"/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/.gitignore "$PROJECT_DIR"/
cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"/.mcp.json "$PROJECT_DIR"/
```

### Step 0.4: Initialize git

```bash
cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial scaffold from vibe-demo-accelerator"
```

If `git` is not installed or the command fails, skip gracefully and tell the user: "Git init skipped — you can initialize the repo later."

### Step 0.5: Write phase_0 config

Write `PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Demo Configuration — generated by /new-demo wizard
# Phase 0: Project Setup
phase_0:
  scaffold_source: "<absolute path to scaffold directory>"
  project_dir: "<absolute path to PROJECT_DIR>"
  created_at: "<ISO 8601 timestamp>"
```

### Step 0.6: Confirm and continue

Show a summary:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        PROJECT CREATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Directory:  <PROJECT_DIR>
Files:      <count> files copied from scaffold
Git:        initialized (or skipped)

The scaffold directory is untouched.
All generated code will go into this project.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Proceed directly to Phase 1 (no restart needed yet).

---

## Phase 1: Customer Discovery & Story

Tell the user: "Let's start by understanding the customer. I'll research them so the demo resonates with their actual business. I'll ask a few questions — skip any you don't have context on."

### Step 1.1: Collect customer basics

Ask these questions (use AskUserQuestion):

**1.1a Customer name** — What's the customer name?
- Free text. This should be the real company name (we'll use it for research). If they prefer a fictional name for the demo itself, we'll ask later.

**1.1b Customer website** — What's their website URL?
- Free text. e.g., `https://www.simplot.com`

**1.1c Salesforce context** — Paste a Salesforce link, account name, or UCO ID — or skip.
- Accept ANY of the following formats:
  - **Salesforce URL** — UCO link (`https://databricks.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Use_Case__c/a0x.../view`), Account link, or Opportunity link. Parse the object type and record ID from the URL.
  - **Account name** — e.g., "Simplot" (will search Salesforce)
  - **UCO ID** — e.g., "a0x..." (will fetch directly)
  - **"Skip"** — No Salesforce data available. Ask them to describe the use case in 2-3 sentences instead: What's the business problem? What data do they have? What outcome do they want?
- If a Salesforce link or ID is provided, use the `salesforce-actions` skill / `field-data-analyst` subagent to pull:
  - UCO name, stage, description, implementation status
  - Account details (industry, segment, ARR)
  - **All related UCOs on the same account** — shows the full engagement picture
  - Related opportunities and blockers
  - ASQs / specialist requests on the account
  - SA and AE names
- If an Account name/link is provided (not a specific UCO), also list all UCOs on the account and ask the SA which one(s) this demo is for.

### Step 1.2: SA context interview

Tell the user: "A few quick questions so I can tailor the research. Skip any that don't apply — just say 'skip' or 'N/A'."

**All questions in this step are skippable.** If the SA says "skip", "N/A", "don't know", or anything indicating they want to move on, accept it and proceed. Do NOT re-ask or push for an answer.

**1.2a Use case description** — In 2-3 sentences, what's the customer trying to solve?
- What's the business problem? What data do they have? What outcome do they want?
- If the UCO description from Step 1.1c already covers this well, propose it and ask: "The UCO says: `<description>`. Is this still accurate, or has the scope changed?"

**1.2b Current state** — What are they using today?
- Options: "Snowflake", "AWS (EMR/Glue/Redshift)", "Azure (Synapse/ADF)", "GCP (BigQuery)", "Legacy DW (Teradata/Oracle/Netezza)", "Spark on-prem", "Not sure / Skip"
- Multi-select allowed. This informs competitive positioning and migration narratives.

**1.2c Demo audience** — Who'll be in the room?
- Options: "Technical (data engineers, architects)", "Mixed (technical + business)", "Executive (VP+, C-suite)", "Not sure / Skip"
- If they provide specifics (names, titles), note them. This drives UI complexity and talk track tone.

**1.2d What matters most** — What's the #1 thing that would make them say "wow"?
- Options: "AI / intelligent agents", "Performance / speed", "Cost savings", "Governance / security", "Simplicity / unified platform", "Not sure / Skip"
- This becomes the demo's centerpiece — the "wow moment" we build toward.

**1.2e Competitive context** — Is there a competitive eval happening?
- Options: "Yes, against Snowflake", "Yes, against another vendor", "No active competition", "Not sure / Skip"
- If yes: note the competitor. Research will include competitive intelligence.

**1.2f Data sources** — What data systems or sources are involved?
- Free text. e.g., "S3, Kafka, Salesforce, SAP, flat files from vendors"
- If skipped, the research phase will try to infer from the customer's tech stack.

**1.2g Timeline** — When's the demo?
- Options: "This week", "Next 1-2 weeks", "Next month", "No specific date / Skip"
- This sets the urgency level — affects how polished vs. rapid the build should be.

### Step 1.3: Automated research (Pass 1)

**IMPORTANT: Do this research AUTOMATICALLY after Steps 1.1-1.2. Do NOT skip this step.**

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch ALL of the following research tasks simultaneously using the Task tool:**

1. **Customer website deep-dive** (Task: Explore agent) — Use WebFetch on the customer's website. Visit multiple pages:
   - Homepage — what they do, products, services
   - About page — company scale, history, leadership
   - Newsroom / Press releases — recent initiatives, partnerships, challenges
   - Investor page (if public) — revenue, strategy, risks
   - Careers / Tech blog — technology stack hints, engineering culture
   - **USE CASE CROSS-REFERENCE:** If the SA mentioned a specific use case area (e.g., "genomics"), also search `site:<customer-domain> <use-case-keywords>`. For example, if the SA says "Simplot + genomics", fetch `site:simplot.com genomics` results. Look for the customer's own description of their work in that area — their terminology, their scale, their goals. This makes the demo speak the customer's language.
   - Extract brand colors from the website CSS/visual style

2. **Industry + use case web search** (Task: general-purpose agent) — Use WebSearch for:
   - `"<customer name>" <use case keywords>` — find the customer's own public statements about the use case
   - `"<customer name>" data analytics OR "data platform" OR Databricks` — find their data initiatives
   - `"<customer name>" recent news <current year>` — last 6 months of news
   - `<industry> <use case> challenges trends <current year>` — industry context
   - `"<customer name>" competitors` — market position
   - If SA provided competitive context (Step 1.2e): `"<customer name>" vs "<competitor>"` and `"<customer name>" "<competitor>" migration OR evaluation`
   - If SA provided data sources (Step 1.2f): `"<customer name>" <data source keywords>` to find how they use those systems

3. **Salesforce context** (Task: field-data-analyst, if Salesforce data available from Step 1.1c) — From the UCO/account data:
   - What Databricks products are they evaluating?
   - What stage is the engagement in?
   - Any known technical requirements or blockers?
   - Historical engagement notes
   - **All UCOs on the account** — shows the full engagement breadth
   - Related opportunities, ASQs, and specialist requests

4. **Internal knowledge** (Task: general-purpose agent, if Glean/Slack MCP available) — Search for:
   - Internal Slack conversations about this customer
   - Previous demo materials or POC docs
   - Technical notes from other SAs who've worked with them

**Wait for all parallel tasks to complete before proceeding.**

### Step 1.4: Targeted deep-dives (Pass 2)

After Pass 1 completes, review the findings for opportunities to go deeper. **This pass is automatic — do NOT ask the user before doing it.**

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch follow-up research tasks based on Pass 1 findings:**

- **If Pass 1 found a press release or news article about a data/tech initiative** → WebFetch the full article, extract specifics (budget, timeline, partners, technology names)
- **If Pass 1 found a 10-K, annual report, or investor presentation** → WebFetch and extract: risk factors mentioning data/analytics, strategic priorities, technology investment plans, regulatory challenges
- **If Pass 1 found an engineering blog, tech talk, or conference presentation** → WebFetch and extract: current tech stack, architecture decisions, scale metrics, pain points
- **If SA mentioned a competitor (Step 1.2e)** → WebSearch for `"<competitor>" Databricks OR "data lakehouse" case study` to find counter-positioning material
- **If Pass 1 found the customer on Databricks community, GitHub, or job postings** → Extract: what Databricks features they use, what roles they're hiring for (signals investment areas)

**Skip this step entirely if Pass 1 didn't surface anything worth following up on.** Don't do deep-dives just for the sake of it.

### Step 1.5: Present research findings

After both research passes, present a **Customer Brief** to the user:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        CUSTOMER BRIEF
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Company:      <name>
Industry:     <industry / sub-vertical>
Scale:        <revenue, employees, locations>
Website:      <url>

WHAT THEY DO
<2-3 sentences summarizing their business>

THEIR WORK IN <USE CASE AREA> (from website/public sources)
<What the customer themselves say about this area — their terminology,
their programs, their scale. This section makes the demo speak their language.>

CURRENT STATE (from SA + research)
  Platform:   <what they use today — Snowflake, EMR, etc.>
  Data:       <known data sources — S3, Kafka, SAP, etc.>
  Pain:       <what's broken or missing>

KEY CHALLENGES (from research)
- <challenge 1 — from website/news>
- <challenge 2 — from industry context>
- <challenge 3 — from Salesforce/SA notes>

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (if applicable)
  Competitor: <name>
  Their pitch: <what competitor offers>
  Our edge:   <where Databricks wins>

DEMO AUDIENCE
  Who:        <titles, technical level>
  Wow factor: <what matters most to them>
  Timeline:   <when's the demo>

SALESFORCE (if available)
  UCO:        <name> — Stage: <stage>
  Account:    <name> — ARR: <arr>
  SA/AE:      <names>
  Other UCOs: <list of other active UCOs on account>

DEMO OPPORTUNITY
<How Databricks + this demo can address their specific challenges>

BRAND COLORS (extracted from website)
  Primary: <hex>  Accent: <hex>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 1.6: Gap-filling conversation

After presenting the Customer Brief, ask: **"Here's what I found. What did I miss or get wrong? Skip anything that looks fine."**

**All questions in this step are skippable.** Only ask questions where the research left clear gaps. Do NOT re-ask things the SA already answered in Step 1.2.

Pick 2-4 of the following based on what's actually missing (do NOT ask all of them):

- **If research didn't reveal their data sources:** "Do you know what data systems they use? (e.g., S3, Kafka, Salesforce, SAP, flat files)"
- **If research didn't reveal their tech stack:** "Any idea what their current analytics/data platform looks like?"
- **If the use case area is still vague:** "Can you be more specific about the use case? What data goes in, what insight comes out?"
- **If the demo audience is unknown:** "Any idea who'll be in the room? Technical depth matters for the demo design."
- **If there are political sensitivities:** "Anything I should avoid mentioning? (e.g., a specific competitor name, a failed project, a sensitive topic)"
- **If the business impact is unclear:** "Do you have any metrics on the cost of the current problem? (e.g., '$8M in annual overstocking', '3-day manual reporting cycle')"

**Then ask:** "Anything else I should know that wouldn't show up in a web search?"

### Step 1.7: Define the demo story

Based on all research + SA context, propose a demo story and ask the user to confirm or adjust:

**1.7a Demo name** — Propose a name based on the customer + use case (e.g., "Simplot Genomics Intelligence Platform", "Apex Steel Predictive Maintenance"). Ask if they want to use the real customer name or a fictional one.

**1.7b Industry / Vertical** — Confirm the industry based on research. Don't ask if it's obvious.

**1.7c Key use cases** — Propose 2-4 use cases that align with the customer's actual challenges (from research). These should NOT be generic — they should use the customer's own terminology discovered during research. For example:
  - Instead of "genomics analytics" → "Accelerate Simplot's marker-assisted selection pipeline by unifying genotype data from 3 breeding programs with field trial phenotype data"
  - Instead of "demand forecasting" → "Forecast frozen potato product demand across Simplot's 12 distribution centers to reduce the $8M annual overstocking problem"

**1.7d Demo narrative** — Draft a 3-4 sentence narrative that:
  - Uses terminology and specifics found on the customer's own website
  - References their current state and pain points (from SA interview)
  - Describes the specific problem the demo solves
  - Shows the Databricks-powered solution
  - Mentions the expected business impact (quantified if the SA provided metrics)
  - If competitive eval: subtly highlights where Databricks wins
  - Present this to the user and ask if it captures the right story.

### Step 1.8: Confirm or adjust

Show the complete Phase 1 summary and ask: "Does this capture the right story? Change anything you'd like."

**After the user confirms**, append to `PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Phase 1: Customer Discovery & Story
story:
  customer_name: "<real company name>"
  demo_name: "<demo display name — may use fictional name>"
  website: "<url>"
  industry: "<industry>"

  customer_context: |
    <what the customer themselves say about the use case area,
    using their terminology — from website/public sources>
  current_state:
    platforms: ["<current data platforms>"]
    data_sources: ["<known data sources>"]
    pain_points: ["<what's broken>"]
  audience:

## Phase 2: Infrastructure

Tell the user: "Now let's set up the Databricks infrastructure."

**2.1 FEVM workspace** — Do you already have an FEVM workspace for this demo?
- Options: "Yes, I have one", "No, I need to create one"
- If NO: Guide them to run `/databricks-fe-vm-workspace-deployment` (Serverless Template 3, AWS). Tell them to come back when it's ready. **Pause this wizard until they confirm the workspace is created.**
- If YES: Continue.

**2.2 Workspace URL** — What's the workspace URL?
- Free text. Expect format: `https://fe-sandbox-serverless-<name>.cloud.databricks.com`

**2.3 CLI profile** — What's the Databricks CLI profile name?
- Suggest: the workspace name (e.g., `my-demo`). Remind them to run `databricks auth login <url> --profile=<name>` if not set up.
- **IMMEDIATELY after getting the profile**, update `PROJECT_DIR/.mcp.json` to wire the Databricks MCP server with the user's profile:
```python
# Write PROJECT_DIR/.mcp.json with the CLI profile
import json
mcp_config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "databricks": {
            "command": "~/ai-dev-kit/databricks-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
            "args": ["~/ai-dev-kit/databricks-mcp-server/run_server.py"],
            "env": {"DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE": "<profile>"}
        }
    }
}
```
- Tell the user: "I've configured `.mcp.json` with your CLI profile. **You need to restart Claude Code in the new project directory** to pick up the Databricks MCP tools. Run: `cd PROJECT_DIR && claude`. Then run `/new-demo` — it will detect your config and resume from Phase 3."
- **Pause the wizard.** The user must restart Claude Code in `PROJECT_DIR` for MCP tools to load. When they re-run `/new-demo`, Step 0.0 will detect the existing `demo-config.yaml` with `phase_0` + `story` + partial `infrastructure` sections and resume at the next incomplete question.

**2.4 Catalog name** — What's the Unity Catalog name?
- Suggest: `serverless_<name_with_underscores>_catalog` (FEVM auto-creates this). Ask them to confirm.

**2.5 Schema name** — What schema should we use?
- Suggest: based on the demo name from Phase 1 (e.g., `apex_steel_pm`). Use underscores, lowercase.

**2.6 SQL Warehouse ID** — What's the SQL warehouse ID?
- Tell them where to find it: Workspace → SQL Warehouses → click the warehouse → copy the ID from the URL or details page.

**2.7 Shared Lakebase MCP Server** — Do you already have a shared Lakebase MCP server deployed (`lakebase-mcp-server` app)?
- Options: "Yes, it's already deployed", "No, this is the first demo"
- If YES:
  - **2.7a MCP App URL** — What's the Lakebase MCP server app URL? (e.g., `https://lakebase-mcp-server-<hash>.cloud.databricks.com`)
  - **2.7b MCP App SP Client ID** — What's the service principal client ID for the MCP app? (Find this in Workspace → Apps → lakebase-mcp-server → Settings, or from `databricks apps get lakebase-mcp-server`)
  - Explain: "Since the shared MCP server already exists, I'll add your new demo's database as a resource and create a UC HTTP connection with database routing (`/db/<database>/mcp/`)."
- If NO:
  - Explain: "I'll deploy the shared Lakebase MCP server for the first time during Phase 8C. It's named `lakebase-mcp-server` (not per-demo) and supports multi-database routing so future demos can reuse it."

**After collecting all answers**, append to `PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Phase 2: Infrastructure
infrastructure:
  workspace_url: "<answer>"
  cli_profile: "<answer>"
  catalog: "<answer>"
  schema: "<answer>"
  sql_warehouse_id: "<answer>"
  shared_mcp_server:
    exists: true|false
    app_url: "<answer if exists>"
    sp_client_id: "<answer if exists>"
```

Show summary and ask: "Phase 2 complete. Does this look right?"

---

## Phase 3: Data Model

Tell the user: "Now let's define the data model — what tables and metrics your demo needs."

**Use the research from Phase 1** to propose entities and KPIs that match the customer's actual business. Use the terminology found on their website. Don't just offer generic examples — tailor them.

**3.1 Main entities** — What are the primary entities in this demo?
- **Propose entities based on Phase 1 research.** For example, if you learned the customer is a food manufacturer doing genomics work with 3 breeding programs, propose: `breeding_programs`, `genotype_samples`, `field_trials`, `phenotype_observations`, `marker_panels`, `selection_candidates` — not generic "machines" and "sensors."
- If research didn't reveal enough, fall back to industry examples:
  - Manufacturing: machines, sensors, work_orders, spare_parts, production_lines
  - Healthcare: patients, beds, operating_rooms, staff, appointments
  - Financial: loans, borrowers, risk_scores, transactions, alerts
  - Retail: products, stores, orders, customers, promotions
  - Supply Chain: shipments, purchase_orders, inventory, suppliers, warehouses
- Ask them to confirm, add, or remove entities. Target 4-6.

**3.2 Key metrics / KPIs** — What numbers should appear on the dashboard?
- **Propose KPIs based on Phase 1 use cases and research.** For example, if the use case is genomics-driven breeding, propose: `selection_accuracy`, `breeding_cycle_time`, `trial_throughput`, `marker_hit_rate`, `genetic_gain_per_year`.
- If research didn't reveal enough, fall back to industry examples:
  - Manufacturing: OEE, MTBF, MTTR, defect rate, machine uptime %
  - Healthcare: avg wait time, bed utilization %, surgical throughput, readmission rate
  - Financial: portfolio value, default rate, VaR, credit score distribution
  - Retail: revenue, conversion rate, inventory turnover, out-of-stock rate
  - Supply Chain: on-time delivery %, fill rate, days of supply, freight cost per unit
- Ask them to pick 4-6 KPIs.

**3.3 Historical data range** — How much historical data should we generate?
- Options: "3 months", "6 months", "1 year", "2 years"

**3.4 Operational (Lakebase) tables** — Which entities need real-time read/write for the AI agent?
- Explain: "Delta Lake tables are for analytics (read-only dashboards). Lakebase tables are for operational data the AI agent can create and update (e.g., work orders, alerts, notes)."
- Suggest operational tables based on their entities. Typically: notes (always), agent_actions (always), workflows (always — these are core), plus 2-3 domain tables.

**After collecting all answers**, append to `PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Phase 3: Data Model
data_model:
  entities:
    - name: "<entity>"
      description: "<brief description>"
      layer: "delta"  # or "lakebase" or "both"
  kpis:
    - name: "<KPI name>"
      description: "<what it measures>"

## Phase 4: AI Layer

Tell the user: "Now let's configure the AI agents — Genie Space for data queries and MAS for orchestration."

**4.1 Genie Space tables** — Which Delta Lake tables should Genie be able to query with natural language?
- Suggest: all Delta Lake entities from Phase 3. The user can deselect any that shouldn't be queryable.

**4.2 MAS supervisor persona** — What role should the AI supervisor play?
- Generate a persona based on Phase 1 research that uses the customer's domain language. For example:
  - "You are an AI genomics operations assistant for Simplot. You help breeders analyze marker data, track field trial results, and identify top selection candidates across Simplot's 3 breeding programs..."
- Offer to generate one or let them write their own.

**4.3 Sub-agents** — What capabilities should the MAS have?
- Always include: Genie Space (data queries), Lakebase MCP (writes)
- Optional: Knowledge Assistant (docs/policies), UC functions (custom logic)
- Ask: "Beyond data queries (Genie) and database writes (Lakebase MCP), do you need a Knowledge Assistant for documents/policies, or any custom UC functions?"

**4.4 Lakebase MCP** — Should we deploy the Lakebase MCP server for agent writes?
- Options: "Yes (recommended)", "No, read-only agent is fine"
- Default to yes. Explain: "This lets the AI create work orders, update statuses, add notes — anything that writes to the database."

**After collecting all answers**, append to `PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Phase 4: AI Layer
ai_layer:
  genie_tables:
    - "<table 1>"
    - "<table 2>"
  mas_persona: "<description>"
  sub_agents:
    - type: "genie-space"  # MAS agent_type uses kebab-case
      description: "<what it queries>"
    - type: "external-mcp-server"  # Lakebase MCP connection
      description: "<what it writes>"
    - type: "knowledge-assistant"  # if selected
      description: "<what docs it knows>"
  deploy_lakebase_mcp: true
```

Show summary and ask: "Phase 4 complete. Does this look right?"

## Phase 5: UI

Tell the user: "Now let's design the look and feel."

**5.1 Layout style** — How should the app be laid out?
- Options: "Sidebar navigation (most common)", "Top navigation bar", "Dashboard-first (data-heavy)"
- Show a brief description of each.

**5.2 Color scheme** — What colors fit the customer's brand?
- **If Phase 1 research extracted brand colors**, propose those first: "I found these brand colors from their website: primary `<hex>`, accent `<hex>`. Should I use these?"
- Otherwise offer presets: "Dark industrial (navy/orange) — great for manufacturing", "Clean medical (white/teal) — great for healthcare", "Corporate blue (navy/blue) — great for finance", "Custom — I'll provide hex colors"
- If custom: ask for primary color (dark), accent color (bright), and optionally brand logo URL.

**5.3 Dashboard content** — What should the main landing page show?
- Options (multi-select): "KPI cards with key metrics", "Charts / visualizations", "Recent activity table", "Morning briefing / AI summary", "Command center with AI input", "Alerts / notifications panel"
- They can pick multiple.

**5.4 Additional pages** — Beyond AI Chat and Agent Workflows (included by default), what pages do you need?
- Suggest based on their entities from Phase 3. For example if they have "breeding_programs" and "field_trials", suggest "Breeding Programs" and "Field Trials" pages.
- Let them add/remove pages.

**After collecting all answers**, append to `PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml`:
```yaml
# Phase 5: UI
ui:
  layout: "<sidebar|topnav|dashboard-first>"
  color_scheme:
    preset: "<brand-match|dark-industrial|clean-medical|corporate-blue|custom>"
    primary: "<hex>"
    accent: "<hex>"
  dashboard:
    - "kpi_cards"
    - "charts"
    - "recent_activity"
  pages:
    - name: "Dashboard"
      description: "<what it shows>"
    - name: "AI Chat"
      description: "Built-in — SSE streaming chat with MAS"
    - name: "Agent Workflows"
      description: "Built-in — workflow cards with agent orchestration"
    - name: "<Custom page>"
      description: "<what it shows>"
```

## Phase 6: Plan & Approve

After all 5 Q&A phases, display a **full configuration summary**:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
           DEMO CONFIGURATION SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CUSTOMER
  Company:     <real name>
  Demo Name:   <display name>
  Industry:    <industry / sub-vertical>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Then **enter plan mode** using the `EnterPlanMode` tool. In plan mode:

1. Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/GOTCHAS.md` + `docs/API_PATTERNS.md` + `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for all patterns and conventions.
2. Create a detailed implementation plan that lists every file to be created/modified, with a brief description of what goes in each.
3. Organize the plan into the 4 deployment phases (A through D) from the scaffold.
4. Include parallelization notes for each phase.
5. Exit plan mode with `ExitPlanMode` for user approval.

**The user must approve the plan before any code is generated.**

---

## Phase 7: Build

Once the plan is approved, generate all code. **Use the Task tool aggressively for parallel work.**

### Step 7.1: Generate config files

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch these simultaneously:**

- **Task 1:** Fill in `PROJECT_DIR/CLAUDE.md` — Replace all TODO values in the Project Identity section.
- **Task 2:** Fill in `PROJECT_DIR/app/app.yaml` — Set warehouse ID, catalog, schema. Leave MAS tile ID and Lakebase as TODO (created during deployment).
- **Task 3:** Generate `PROJECT_DIR/lakebase/domain_schema.sql` — Create tables for the Lakebase entities.
- **Task 4:** Fill in `PROJECT_DIR/notebooks/01_setup_schema.sql` — Set catalog and schema names.
- **Task 5:** Verify `PROJECT_DIR/.mcp.json` has the CLI profile set (should already be done from Phase 2.3, but confirm it's not still `"TODO"`).

### Step 7.2: Generate data + backend

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch these simultaneously:**

- **Task 1:** Generate `PROJECT_DIR/notebooks/02_generate_data.py` — Create data generation for all Delta Lake entities, using the KPIs and historical range from Phase 3. Use deterministic hash-based generation for reproducibility.
- **Task 2:** Generate `PROJECT_DIR/notebooks/03_seed_lakebase.py` — Create seeding for Lakebase operational tables.
- **Task 3:** Generate domain API routes in `PROJECT_DIR/app/backend/main.py` — Add endpoints for each entity (list, detail, filters, CRUD for Lakebase entities). **CRITICAL: Wire workflow approval side-effects** (Gotcha #26). For each `workflow_type` from Phase 3/4, implement `_execute_workflow_actions(wf_row)` that dispatches domain-specific writes on approve (entity updates, notes, agent_actions records) and `_record_dismiss(wf_row)` for the audit trail. Without this, the Agent Workflows "Approve" button only changes status — no domain actions execute and the demo looks broken. Return `actions_taken` list from the PATCH response. Update frontend `approveWorkflow()`/`dismissWorkflow()` to show flash messages from the response.

### Step 7.3: Generate frontend

Generate the frontend in `PROJECT_DIR/app/frontend/src/index.html` based on Phase 5 UI preferences:
- Set CSS variables for the color scheme (use brand colors from research)
- Build the layout (sidebar/topnav/dashboard-first)
- Create the dashboard page with selected components
- Create additional domain pages
- Keep AI Chat and Agent Workflows as-is (just customize `formatAgentName()` and suggested prompts)

### Step 7.4: Generate agent configs

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch these simultaneously:**

- **Task 1:** Generate `PROJECT_DIR/agent_bricks/mas_config.json` — Configure MAS with the persona and sub-agents.
- **Task 2:** Generate `PROJECT_DIR/genie_spaces/config.json` — Configure Genie Space with the selected tables.

### Step 7.5: Code review checkpoint

After all generation is complete, show the user a summary of what was generated:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        CODE GENERATION COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Files created/modified:
  [x] CLAUDE.md (project identity filled)
  [x] app/app.yaml (config set)
  [x] app/backend/main.py (N domain routes added)
  [x] app/frontend/src/index.html (dashboard + N pages)
  [x] lakebase/domain_schema.sql (N tables)
  [x] notebooks/01_setup_schema.sql
  [x] notebooks/02_generate_data.py (N Delta tables)
  [x] notebooks/03_seed_lakebase.py (N Lakebase tables)
  [x] agent_bricks/mas_config.json
  [x] genie_spaces/config.json

Ready to deploy?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Ask: **"Code generation is complete. Ready to start deployment? I'll walk you through each step."**

---

## Phase 8: Deploy

Walk the user through deployment step by step. **This stays within the /new-demo flow.** After each deployment step, report status and move to the next.

### Step 8A: Delta Lake Data

Tell the user: "Deploying Phase A — creating the schema and generating Delta Lake data."

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch simultaneously:**
- **Task 1:** Verify CLI profile and workspace access: `databricks current-user me --profile=<profile>`
- **Task 2:** Create schema: Run `notebooks/01_setup_schema.sql` content via `execute_sql` MCP tool

Then: Run `notebooks/02_generate_data.py` via `execute_sql` or `run_python_file_on_databricks` MCP tool.

Report: "Phase A complete — N Delta Lake tables created with X rows."

### Step 8B: Lakebase

Tell the user: "Deploying Phase B — setting up Lakebase."

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch simultaneously (Lakebase instance takes 5-6 min, use that time):**
- **Task 1:** Create Lakebase instance: `databricks database create-instance <name> --profile=<profile>`
- **Task 2:** While instance provisions, seed Lakebase data by running `notebooks/03_seed_lakebase.py`... actually, wait — seeding needs the instance. Instead, prepare the seed data and commands.

Sequential steps:
1. Create Lakebase instance (wait for RUNNING state)
2. Create database in the instance
3. Apply `lakebase/core_schema.sql`
4. Apply `lakebase/domain_schema.sql`
5. Run `notebooks/03_seed_lakebase.py`

Report: "Phase B complete — Lakebase instance running, N tables created and seeded."

### Step 8C: AI Layer

Tell the user: "Deploying Phase C — setting up the AI agents."

**`[PARALLEL]` — Launch simultaneously:**
- **Task 1:** Create Genie Space, PATCH table_identifiers, grant CAN_RUN
- **Task 2:** Set up Lakebase MCP Server (shared — see below)

**Lakebase MCP Server (shared — deploy once, reuse across demos):**

The MCP server is named `lakebase-mcp-server` (NOT per-demo). It supports multi-database routing via `/db/{database}/mcp/`.

1. **Check if the shared MCP server already exists** (use answer from Phase 2.7, or verify now):
   ```bash
   databricks apps get lakebase-mcp-server --profile=<profile>
   ```

2. **If it exists (second+ demo):**
   a. Get the existing app's resources to know what databases are already registered:
      ```bash
      databricks apps get lakebase-mcp-server --profile=<profile>
      ```
      Look at the `resources` array to find all currently registered databases.
   b. Add the new demo's database to the resources array — **you MUST include ALL existing databases** (the update replaces the entire array, not appends):
      ```bash
      databricks apps update lakebase-mcp-server --json '{
        "resources": [
          {"name": "database", "database": {"instance_name": "<instance>", "database_name": "<existing_db_1>", "permission": "CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE"}},
          {"name": "database-2", "database": {"instance_name": "<instance>", "database_name": "<existing_db_2>", "permission": "CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE"}},
          {"name": "database-N", "database": {"instance_name": "<instance>", "database_name": "<new_demo_db>", "permission": "CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE"}}
        ]
      }' --profile=<profile>
      ```
   c. **Redeploy** to grant SP access to the new database (resource registration alone does NOT grant access):
      ```bash
      databricks apps deploy lakebase-mcp-server --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/<you>/lakebase-mcp-server/app --profile=<profile>
      ```
   d. Grant table access to the MCP server's SP in the new database:
      ```bash
      databricks psql <instance> --profile=<profile> -- -d <new_demo_db> -c "
      GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO \"<mcp-app-sp-client-id>\";
      GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO \"<mcp-app-sp-client-id>\";
      ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO \"<mcp-app-sp-client-id>\";
      "
      ```
   e. Create a UC HTTP connection for this demo with database routing:
      - **Type:** HTTP
      - **base_path:** `/db/<new_demo_database>/mcp/` (routes to this demo's database)
      - **Auth:** Databricks OAuth M2M (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `oauth_scope=all-apis`)
      - **host:** `<mcp-app-url>`, **port:** `443`

3. **If it does NOT exist (first demo):**
   a. Update `PROJECT_DIR/lakebase-mcp-server/app/app.yaml` with the Lakebase instance and database names
   b. Create the app:
      ```bash
      databricks apps create lakebase-mcp-server --profile=<profile>
      ```
   c. Sync and deploy:
      ```bash
      databricks sync PROJECT_DIR/lakebase-mcp-server/app /Workspace/Users/<you>/lakebase-mcp-server/app --profile=<profile> --watch=false
      databricks apps deploy lakebase-mcp-server --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/<you>/lakebase-mcp-server/app --profile=<profile>
      ```
   d. Register the database resource via API:
      ```bash
      databricks apps update lakebase-mcp-server --json '{
        "resources": [
          {"name": "database", "database": {"instance_name": "<instance>", "database_name": "<database>", "permission": "CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE"}}
        ]
      }' --profile=<profile>
      ```
   e. **Redeploy** after resource registration (required for SP access):
      ```bash
      databricks apps deploy lakebase-mcp-server --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/<you>/lakebase-mcp-server/app --profile=<profile>
      ```
   f. Grant CAN_USE to users group (required for MAS proxy):
      ```bash
      databricks api patch /api/2.0/permissions/apps/lakebase-mcp-server \
        --json '{"access_control_list":[{"group_name":"users","permission_level":"CAN_USE"}]}' \
        --profile=<profile>
      ```
   g. Grant table access to the app's SP:
      ```bash
      databricks psql <instance> --profile=<profile> -- -d <database> -c "
      GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO \"<mcp-app-sp-client-id>\";
      GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO \"<mcp-app-sp-client-id>\";
      ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO \"<mcp-app-sp-client-id>\";
      "
      ```
   h. Create a UC HTTP connection for this demo:
      - **Type:** HTTP
      - **base_path:** `/db/<database>/mcp/` (database routing path)
      - **Auth:** Databricks OAuth M2M (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `oauth_scope=all-apis`)
      - **host:** `<mcp-app-url>`, **port:** `443`

**Sequential after parallel (requires Genie Space ID + MCP connection ID):**
1. Create MAS with all sub-agents (include Genie Space + Lakebase MCP connection)

**CRITICAL — Write agent IDs back to config files (required for Architecture page):**

After creating the Genie Space and MAS, you MUST write the IDs back so the app can discover its agents:

2. **Extract IDs:**
   - `GENIE_SPACE_ID` — from the Genie Space creation response (the space ID)
   - `MAS_TILE_ID` — the first 8 characters of the MAS tile_id (find via: `databricks serving-endpoints get mas-<tile>-endpoint --profile=<profile>`, look at `tile_endpoint_metadata.tile_id`, take first 8 chars)
   - `KA_TILE_ID` — if a Knowledge Assistant was created, extract its tile ID

3. **Update `app/app.yaml`** — replace the TODO placeholders with real IDs:
   ```bash
   # Update MAS_TILE_ID
   sed -i '' 's/name: MAS_TILE_ID\n    value: "TODO"/name: MAS_TILE_ID\n    value: "<actual_mas_tile_id>"/' PROJECT_DIR/app/app.yaml
   # Update GENIE_SPACE_ID
   sed -i '' 's/name: GENIE_SPACE_ID\n    value: "TODO"/name: GENIE_SPACE_ID\n    value: "<actual_genie_space_id>"/' PROJECT_DIR/app/app.yaml
   # Update KA_TILE_ID (if applicable)
   sed -i '' 's/name: KA_TILE_ID\n    value: "TODO"/name: KA_TILE_ID\n    value: "<actual_ka_tile_id>"/' PROJECT_DIR/app/app.yaml
   ```
   Alternatively, use Python/yq to update the YAML in-place. The key env var names are `MAS_TILE_ID`, `GENIE_SPACE_ID`, and `KA_TILE_ID`.

4. **Update `demo-config.yaml`** — add the IDs to the `ai_layer` section:
   ```yaml
   ai_layer:
     genie_space_id: "<actual_genie_space_id>"
     mas_tile_id: "<actual_mas_tile_id>"
     ka_tile_id: "<actual_ka_tile_id>"   # if applicable
   ```
   This ensures `_agents_from_demo_config()` can resolve agents even if the live MAS API call fails.

5. **Update `app/app.yaml` resources** — replace TODO in the MAS endpoint resource:
   Replace `"mas-TODO-endpoint"` with `"mas-<actual_mas_tile_id>-endpoint"` in the resources section.

Report: "Phase C complete — Genie Space, MAS, and Lakebase MCP server deployed. Agent IDs written to app.yaml and demo-config.yaml."

### Step 8D: App Deploy

Tell the user: "Deploying Phase D — deploying the app and registering resources."

Sequential steps:
1. **Copy config files into app/ for deployment** (CRITICAL — only app/ is synced to workspace):
   ```bash
   cp PROJECT_DIR/demo-config.yaml PROJECT_DIR/app/demo-config.yaml 2>/dev/null || true
   cp PROJECT_DIR/agent_bricks/mas_config.json PROJECT_DIR/app/agent_bricks/mas_config.json 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   This ensures the app can discover its agents via the fallback paths when the live MAS API is unavailable.
2. Sync app code from `PROJECT_DIR/app` to workspace
3. Deploy app: `databricks apps deploy <name> --source-code-path <path> --profile=<profile>`
3. **Register resources via API** (CRITICAL — app.yaml alone does NOT register them):
```bash
databricks apps update <app-name> --json '{
  "resources": [
    {"name": "sql-warehouse", "sql_warehouse": {"id": "<id>", "permission": "CAN_USE"}},
    {"name": "mas-endpoint", "serving_endpoint": {"name": "mas-<tile>-endpoint", "permission": "CAN_QUERY"}},
    {"name": "database", "database": {"instance_name": "<instance>", "database_name": "<db>", "permission": "CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE"}}
  ]
}' --profile=<profile>
```
4. **Redeploy** to inject PGHOST/PGPORT/PGDATABASE/PGUSER env vars
5. Grant SP permissions (SQL warehouse CAN_USE, catalog/schema USE+SELECT, Lakebase table grants)
6. Verify health: `GET /api/health` should return all three checks passing

### Step 8E: Final Verification

After deployment, verify everything works:

1. Report the app URL to the user
2. Check `/api/health` returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
3. If any checks fail, diagnose using the troubleshooting table in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` and fix automatically
4. Tell the user to open the app in their browser (OAuth login required)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            DEMO DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

App URL:      <url>
Health:       healthy (SDK ✓, SQL Warehouse ✓, Lakebase ✓)

Genie Space:  <name> (<N tables>)
MAS:          <name> (<N sub-agents>)
Lakebase MCP: <url>

Next steps:
  1. Open the app URL in your browser
  2. Try the AI Chat with a sample question
  3. Run /demo-talk-track to generate a talk track
  4. Practice the demo flow before the customer meeting

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**IMPORTANT:** Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` for patterns and conventions. For detailed deployment commands, read `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`. For API formats (Genie Space, MAS, UC HTTP), read `docs/API_PATTERNS.md`. For known issues, read `docs/GOTCHAS.md`.
